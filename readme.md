# Automated assistant powered by Python

This program was inspired by the original programmer
that made this project, Ashutosh Krishna.

##Who made this?

Originally, it was made by Ashutosh Krishna.
However, I decided to make my own
modifications and add my own functions in this program.
I could've made a more convoluted program but 
I wasn't in the mood for making it complicated.

##What does this do? 

It automates the stuff you'd normally do when you're 
on your PC or Mac. The only real difference is
just changing the directories to the programs
you want to open.

For example: 
 - If you don't like clicking on a program and waiting
for it to load, then you can just type in  `open discord`
or  `open chrome` and it will automatically open those programs
for you, without all the long wait time.
 - If you want to open your camera but don't have
an interface for it, you can just do `open camera`
and it will immediately search for the camera and open it
using another screen as it's interface.

##Where can I download this?

It has not been turned into an executable
file yet, but it will be soon.
